### About
**RepoHax** is an advanced internal C++ cheat for the game **REPO**, developed with minimal reliance on third-party libraries. The project features custom graphics library and SDK for interacting with the Unity engine directly from C++ (both will be released as standalone open-source projects in the future).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was created for educational purposes as part of a university project. It aims to provide developers with deeper insights into game hacking / mod development aspects.

### Configuration
The menu hotkey, interface language, and menu options can be adjusted in the **Settings** tab and are saved to `haxsdk.ini`.

---

### Installation

For convenience and to avoid using external injectors, this mod utilizes **DLL Proxying**:

1. Download the `version.dll` file.
2. Place it in the game's root directory (the folder containing the `.exe` file).
3. Launch the game. The mod will load automatically and the menu will appear.

*If you prefer using a **DLL Injector**, simply rename dll file to something else and proceed with your preferred injector.*

## ❗ Important Note
Using external mod loaders (such as **BepInEx** or **MelonLoader**) may cause conflicts. RepoHax uses its own hooking system, which may be overwritten by other tools. It is recommended to use this on a clean game installation.
